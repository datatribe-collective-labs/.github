# DataTribe: A Community for Data People

**DataTribe** is a **volunteer-run, passion-driven community** of data professionals.  
We’re here to **support, upskill**, and **grow together** — with no paywalls, no corporate strings, and no hidden agendas.

We believe in sharing knowledge freely, mentoring with empathy, and building a space where anyone in data can find their people.

## What We’re Building

We're creating **community-first infrastructure** for modern data careers — open, practical, and built by practitioners:

- **Open-Source Career Maps**  
  Real pathways, grounded in real experience — not HR templates.

- **Peer Mentorship with Accountability**  
  Side-by-side support with people who care enough to show up.

- **Real-World Projects, Not Portfolio Theater**  
  Contribute to things that matter. Learn by building, not by pretending.

## Why We Exist

> *What people want is community and advice they can trust.*  
> *What companies need is talent and judgment they can trust.*

DataTribe exists to serve both — by putting **people before platforms**, and **trust before transactions**.

## The Long Game

This is a long-term, shared effort — to make data work more **human**, more **accessible**, and more **collaborative**.

If that resonates, you’re already one of us.  

**Welcome to DataTribe.**
